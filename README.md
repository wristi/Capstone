# Capstone
Transfer Learning &amp; Generative AI w/ Pollen Dataset &amp; Lice

- This repository documents the process of using transfer learning to perform image classification on a Pollen dataset.

# Overview: 
- The challenge of this project is to utilize transfer learning & learn the features of Pollen grain images to accurately predict which category they belong to.
- In this repository, our approach is to use labeled/sorted data & perform categorical classification with 5 folders worth of 100-200 Pollen grain images. Using ImageNet weights & the Pollen training data, we used the ResNet101V2 architecture.  
-    ResNet101V2's performance suggests overfitting, clocking around a 99% accuracy and a 96% validation accuracy. Further plans involve Data augmentation, L1 regularization & using less complex models to solve overfitting.
